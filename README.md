# 8-Puzzle

Compilation of blind and informed searches implementing pseudo code from Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd edition.  These
search strategies are applied to solving the 8-puzzle.  Additionally, each will generate information which can be used to analyze and 
compare one against another.  This information includes path cost of solution, number of nodes generated, nodes explored, etc... Overall just having some fun
and attempting to get a better grasp of JavaScript and state space search strategies.
