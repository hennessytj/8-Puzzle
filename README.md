# 8-Puzzle

Compilation of blind and informed searches implementing pseudo code from A Modern Approach to Artificial Intelligence book.  These
search strategies are applied to solving the 8-puzzle.  Additionally, each will generate information which can be used to analyze and 
compare one against another.  This information includes number of nodes generated, nodes explored, etc... Overall just having some fun
and attempting to get a better grasp of JavaScript and search strategies.
